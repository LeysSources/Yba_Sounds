# Yba_Sounds

STILL IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING AND OPTIMIZING

The goal of this project is to play sounds whenever you use a specific keybind specifically designed for YBA
Theres cooldowns so you cant play your sound again until your selected ability is off cooldown

I still have to add the ability to simply create ability buttons for people who dont want to add it into the code themselves!

I also have to make it run a little better however it is in a working state you can compile it and use it to your hearts content

Code is fairly self explanatory so you should be able to tweak it yourself I used threads in some areas where there probably shouldnt be threads Ill be fixing that shortly :3

Have fun use this however you'd like but if you edit the code and make a better working version just be sure to credit me!

You can find some cool voice lines from Hansy_boi on youtube:
